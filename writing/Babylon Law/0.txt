Introduction to Law
by High Priest Adad-Anu, Temple of Greater Babylon
(revised 512 AL)

# Introduction

Greetings, pupil. If you are reading this, you have taken the first step in your Lawpriest training. Yours is a prestigious path, but a difficult one. Many seek to uphold the Law, but very few succeed. As the Law is the foundation of our society and our way of life, only those who pass the most stringent tests can be entrusted to be Bound within it, and to be its guarantors and enforcers. This tablet will give you a basic overview of theory of Law, but only enough to understand your function within it. It is not useful, and in fact almost always harmful, for a Lawpriest to understand theory too deeply. Further development of the Law is entrusted only to the High Priests, a position held by very few even among our number. Instead, this text will assume you are seeking employment in other fields of Law, for example, enforcement, war, divination, etc. The basic understanding granted here will give you a foundation for your continued training.

# Development of Law

All living things exert an influence on Being via their anima, an expression of which we call belief. At the earliest times, humans lived together in simple tribes, and created order in the world via their shared beliefs. Thus they were able to coax crops out of the earth, imbue power to fire, and perform the first healing arts. This could not yet be called Law, but this proto-Law nonetheless gave structure to Being. In these early times the structure of Law was embryonic, and beliefs were scattered and incohesive. A false belief, such as that rain would not fall, or that a sickness could not be cured, could easily spell death for a tribe if allowed to spread among its members. Once questioned, faith in a belief is hard to maintain, and thus the spread of false beliefs led to the doom of many tribes. For this reason, in those early days exile of non-believers was commonly practiced, and tribes could not grow large in number.

This state of things continued for unknown centuries, until the first development of Law in Babylonia. For reasons yet unknown to High Priests, small groups developed the concept of Bounding, and believed that only those who had been Bound with the Law could uphold it. This changed the balance of power away from the individual and to the group, for the Law now stated that an un-Bound individual's belief no longer had any power. Those Bound, the Lawpriests, now held the sole responsibility of enforcing order on Being. To protect this fearsome power, only those who were most unshakeable in their beliefs, and who were most correct in their understanding of Law, were allowed to be Bound. This development gave continuity and structure to proto-Law, bringing Law into existence. Best estimates from our High Priests place this event at around 5700 BL.

The acquisition of Law led to a golden age, where tribes were able to expand rapidly across modern Babylonia, occasionally traveling and splitting into new tribes. However, these new tribes, once out of contact for long enough, eventually developed different beliefs among their Lawpriests. In Babylon we maintained the true Law, but tribes far removed from the center allowed false beliefs to enter their system. Even more troublesome, as time went on we began to encounter various other peoples who had developed systems of un-Law entirely incompatible with the true Law. Texts from Grand Historian Nabu-Mura, writing in 533 BL, detail the history of one such conflict with the Sumerians. The Sumerians, in their ignorance, believed the Euphrates to flow West, connecting to the Western Sea. While our Lawpriests understood the Euphrates to flow East, connecting to the Eastern Sea, the ignorance of the Sumerians caused unpredictable river currents that led to repeated conflicts. Over time, as the Sumerians grew in their use of the river, they began worshipping it, calling it Enbilulu. Their growing influence over the river was the cause of much suffering for Babylon, and our two peoples entered into war in the 12th century BL. This led to a protracted conflict, where Babylon eventually prevailed due to our more developed systems of martial Law. The war ended in the 10th century BL with the defeat of Sumer, upon which the surviving Sumerian people were folded into greater Babylonia. Believers in Enbilulu were slaughtered, and a cadre of Lawpriests then followed the Euphrates on an expedition West, and confirmed their belief that the Euphrates did not, in fact, connect to the Western Sea. Thus the Law was settled.

# Diplomacy in Law

Today, with expanded networks of trade, contact with systems of un-Law have become more difficult to manage. When contacting other peoples, complex systems of diplomatic Law are often required. As one example, consider our trade with the Byzantinians. As you may know, our tablet writing technology does not work in Constantinople. To understand this we must examine how a tablet is erased for rewriting. We know from the Law that there are four fundamental elements - earth, water, air, and fire. These elements layer onto Being endlessly, in the order earth, then air, then fire, then water, then back to earth. Thus when the old Babylonians first chiseled away stone they replaced it with air. Later development of the Law allowed us to heat away air to produce fire, suffocate fire to produce water, and settle water to produce earth. Modern tablets and styluses use this principle to write, store, and rewrite information on a single tablet, allowing lengthy texts to be read on devices like the one you hold now. The Byzantinians share our understanding of the elements (with a false addition of aether), but they incorrectly believe the order to be earth, then air, then water, then fire. Our tablets thus do not work under the influence of their Lawpriests, and often explode in flames if used within Byzantinian borders. Our traders have worked around this by using old stone-type tablets in Byzantine, with simple non-tech chisels. This requires a vast number of heavy tablets to be produced on each trading trip to Byzantine, which are often re-transcribed as soon as they enter our borders.

Why do we not insist on the Byzantinians adopting the true Law? The answer is that their belief in earth following fire is fundamental to their iron production industry. Though false, this belief allows Byzantine to produce iron in bulk. In the interest of not disrupting this industry, our diplomats have chosen to allow this un-Law to persist. When handling cross-border trade, Lawpriests who accompany traders often have to rely on an advanced technique known as Forked Law. To use this technique, the Lawpriest must believe two contradictory sets of ideas simultaneously without a trace of doubt in either. Strenuous training is required to achieve this goal, and the inability to master this skill contributes significantly to the high failure rate of pupils attempting to achieve the Law.

# Mindlock

An indispensable tool in the Lawpriest's arsenal is the concept of Mindlock. If a thought is believed to not only be false, but so false as to be unthinkable, a society can prevent dangerous beliefs from arising altogether. Through a dense network of Mindlock developed over generations, Lawpriests are able to keep the people and each other in check - to not only believe full-heartedly in the Law, but to be unable to think outside of it.

Mindlock presents several interesting challenges. First, we require constant work to keep a society in Mindlock. Though Lawpriests are keepers of the Law, we must remember that our power originates from the cooperating beliefs of the whole of society. When societies are not properly educated in Law, Mindlock can degrade over generations. While one generation may believe a thought to be unthinkable, preventing it from arising in their children, if the second generation lacks understanding of Law they may not adequately prevent such thoughts from arising in the third generation. Over time, beliefs may be worn away bit by bit. This is a particularly challenging problem in remote regions of Babylonia, where the fight against Lawlessness is a constant struggle.

On the other hand, Mindlock too rigid can also be detrimental to a society. History tells of many tribes with forgotten names, who were defeated by their neighbors due to their primative Law. Often, this was because Mindlock had spread to such an extent throughout the tribe that they were unable to imagine new extensions to their existing Law. To combat this tendency, the system of High Priests was developed independently several times across history. In short, the Law states that nothing is unthinkable to the High Priests. This most honored and powerful of roles is entrusted only to the highest devotees of Law, after a lifetime of faithful service.

The first fully modern system of Mindlock, combined with the role of High Priests, was developed under King Hammurabi, in the year we deem 0.

# Limits of Law

As far as the High Priests have been able to determine, there is a limit to human development of Law. We draw a distinction between Fundamental Law and Enforced Law. Fundamental Law is that portion of Law which exists independent of belief. For instance, the movement of the celestial bodies appear to be Fundamental Law, as no human Law has yet been able to influence their motion. Enforced Law refers to, of course, what we commonly know as Law in our everyday lives, in the form practiced by our Lawpriests. It is known that areas far from civilization can be Lawless, where the nature of Being is determined by the strange beliefs of the people living there. But what does Being without the influence of any anima look like? We can be fairly certain such a thing exists, but does it have understandable attributes? The difference between Fundamental and Enforced Law is a major topic of debate among High Priests, which may be captured in the question (first posed during the Sumerian war) of "Does water flow in the absence of Law?".

On a more practical level, the difficulty involved in training new Lawpriests has led to a severe shortage across Babylonia. Lawpriests are required to ensure that crops grow in predictable cycles, that navigation devices work correctly, that mathematical ledgers continue to add up, and that wrongdoers suffer cosmic retribution, among many other things. We constantly face problems of combatting Lawlessness and of maintaining purity of Law within the Lawpriest brotherhood itself. Thus the work of enforcing and developing Law is a constant struggle.

# Lawpriest Training

Throughout your training, you will be taught techniques fundamental to your role, including practice in maintaining faith, ignoring false evidence, persuading or eliminating dissenters, and identifying lapses of belief in the population. Furthermore, all Lawpriest pupils will memorize the basic corpus of Law and their applications. Specific subfields will depend on a pupil's chosen discipline, and can include physical Law, mathematical Law, criminal Law, economic Law, etc.

Congratulations on taking this first step. The training ahead of you will be arduous, and those weak in faith will not make it through. Historically, only one in thirty pupils are found worthy of being Bound with the Law. Be faithful, and you may be one of the few to make it through.
