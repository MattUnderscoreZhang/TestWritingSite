Prompt: Take a simple event: e.g. a man gets off a bus, trips, looks around in embarrassment, and sees a woman smiling.  Describe this event, using the same characters and elements of setting, in two or three 'psychic distances.' You can also change tone, sentence structure, voice, perspective etc. to make it work. Make sure the styles are radically different; otherwise, the exercise is wasted.

"In 1951, relatively early in the campaign of excavations near Dolni Vestonice, a structure sometimes known as the 'magician's hut' was excavated. A circular depression had been dug into the soil above the permafrost, its edge marked by stones and bones, which probably held down the roof of the hut, possibly made of animal skins or branches. The hut was small and at some remove from the other winter shelters. In its centre was a small structure made of clay, thought to be a kiln, within which were found the remains of 2,300 small clay figurines. These were mainly effigies of animals that had been deliberately exploded in the kiln (elsewhere on the site beautiful whole female human figurines were found). These were some of the earliest evidence of fired clay in the world, used not to make functional items like pots but small exploding animals. People formed the animals of wet clay and allowed them to dry before exposing them to high temperatures. The sound, heat, and danger of particles of exploding clay in a small space, together with the contrast in temperature inside and out, made for an intense set of experiences for all within this small hut. Making and exploding figurines of animals commonly hunted, such as reindeer, has been interpreted as hunting magic, as a means of gaining control over animals: hence the magician's hut."

It was a frigid late-autumn night, and the stillness of sleep lay heavy on the steppe. In the cradle of the great mountain and beside the slow-flowing river, a little village flickered with a single light. A squat stick hut, smoke rising in a thin line from a hole in its animal-skin roof, twinkled like a lone terrestrial star in the vast darkness of the world. Within the hut, a group of fifteen or so men sat huddled around the glow of a small kiln. Warmth spilled from the hole in its side, and tongues of flame licked upwards through cracks between its covering tiles. The resulting heat and smoke gave the room an almost smothering atmosphere. The walls of the hut danced with the men's shadows, which swayed in unison with the movement of the fire. This was Arvid's first entry into the hut, and he took everything in with wide eyes. The shaman Veda, eldest of the tribe, gazed into the door of the kiln and chanted with the fire. Terrifying shadows moved over her deformed face, red with the dust of the earth. She spoke of animals, of spirits, of the moon. And as she spoke the men around her listened in silence and stared into the flame. This was the ritual of the hunt, Arvid's first hunt. He wrung his hands silently, trying not to display his nerves. Though his father and the other men were with him, and would protect him from harm, things still happened on the steppe and not everybody was guaranteed to return. And with the rising dawn they would be hunting mammoths...

The sound died in the hut. Looking up, Arvid saw Veda produce three clay figures. With their long trunks and curved tusks, they were unmistakably mammoths. With a sweeping gesture, Veda displayed the figures to the gathered men, then threw them into the fire. Arvid leaned forward. Through the tiles atop the kiln, he could see the clay shapes, resting on a heap of thousands that had come before them - reindeer, foxes, lions, rhinos... As he stared, he envisioned the mammoths beneath his spear, ready to fall at his command. Suddenly, a figurine exploded with a loud pop, flinging a shard of hot clay that jostled the kiln tiles. Arvid jumped, falling back on his haunches and eliciting a burst of laughter from the gathered men. Embarrassed, he looked at his father, who gave him a reassuring smile and a pat on the shoulder.

Within a few minutes, all three mammoths shattered, signifying a successful hunt ahead. The shaman Veda concluded the ceremony, and the men - in high humor - filed out of the hut. Arvid exited last, feeling the shocking cold of the pre-dawn air as it dug into his skin. Above him, the stars stretched into eternity. Behind him, the river sighed softly. And before him, beyond the fence of mammoth bones demarcating their small corner of the world, lay the endless steppe and all the animals within.

Radimir had gone on so many hunts that he had lost count eons ago. Green grass, snow, then green grass again in endless cycles. The movement of sun and moon in circles and circles. Even this hut, with its fire and smoke, was the same as it ever was. Only the people in the hut were different. Today's hunt marked the first arrival of Arvid, a young boy of 12 years. Radimir remembered his first hunt well, how his father and the men of his tribe had smiled to him before the ceremony, and how they had gathered in congratulations after his first kill. Hrodric, Giselbert, Ernulf - all of them were gone now, departed to wander the spirit paths in dark and endless channels beneath the earth. He was the last of them. The last, aside from one. The shaman, Veda, was there on his first hunt and she was here now. Her face, twisted and blind on one side, marked her as one who had a foot in the spirit realm. If not for the gray in her hair and the wrinkles around her eyes, Radimir could believe her to be beyond the reach of time. Closing his eyes, he heard her chants echoing across a thousand years. Snows came and went. Children were born, lived, and died. Animals rose out of the earth and returned to it. Always her hut was full, on the eve of the hunt. And always she spoke the same words, and cast her clay into the fire.

Silence now. Radimir knew the ceremony by heart. Without opening his eyes, he knew that Veda was displaying the mammoths that she had fashioned the previous night. The figures, barely dried, would bear the marks of her fingerprints. Now, swiftly, into the fire! Gone to join the ranks of those countless many that came before, like Hrodric, like his father, and soon - like himself. Radimir's thoughts were interrupted by a loud crack, a thump, and a wave of laughter. He smiled. Young men were often surprised by the clay, but it signified a good hunt ahead.

After a time, the ceremony ended. Radimir stood slowly, feeling his knees pop, and wandered outside with his fellows. He had seen every one of them at their first initiations, and knew them all by their skills. Who knew how many hunts he had left in him? Maybe this would be his last one. Looking up, he gazed into the sky, same as it was when he laid eyes on it for the very first time.

Heat, fire, smoke, and her tribe before her. The spirits in the sky and the spirits in the water. Veda spoke of life and death, of the strange bond between people and animals. She spoke of the sun and of the moon, of the animals that lived by day and the animals that lived by night. She spoke of the earth, and the ones who had come before. The ones who were now wandering in rock, on the other side of the divide. She chanted in rhythm, letting herself drift half into the other world. As she droned, the hut began to flip on its axis - slowly, like the sky turning to night, like the melting of snow into spring - and they were in the spirit world. Through her blind eye, she saw the world without color, illuminated by a sun that was everywhere at once. All the departed ones were there - the hunters, yes, and her old friends Lianna and Freya. Her father and mother. The endless thousands that had come to this place without time, to wander the shadowlands. The animals were here too, waiting to grow out of the earth and to take their turn in the air and the water. Here there were lions, and rabbits, and horses. There were animals long gone and those yet to come. Shadows moved among shadows, leaving marks and channels throughout the rock.

In the crowd she saw her targets. Drawing her talismans, she summoned them to her. Now, a flourish, and into the fire. Far off, across the steppe and among the shade of tall trees, a family of mammoths stirred in their sleep. They were being called back to the other world, their time in the air and water nearly over. The wind blew over their resting place, rustling the leaves and grass like the murmur of a thousand ghosts. The stars shone above them, as it shone across all the many animals and people in the land of the living. A young mammoth was startled awake by the sudden noise, looking frightened and waving his feet around. His mother, soothingly, laid her trunk on his head, making a sound like laughter.

Coming back slowly to the world of the living, Veda said a few concluding words and the ceremony was over. As the men stood and walked out of her hut, she remained sitting. The memories of a thousand years pressed on her shoulders. She was the hunter, the shadow in the rock, the wind in the trees. She was the mammoth. But even a thousand years comes to an end. The shadowlands were calling to her now, and soon she would go to take her place. When she left, she would leave behind the hut, the kiln, and the thousands of animals burned at her alter. Closing her eyes, she dreamed of the sun in the other world.
