Prompt: Take a fairy tale (or urban legend, popular tale, etc.) story or character and twist it into something dark.

The universe is saturated with currents of circulating life. In every grain of dust and breath of wind there is a twinge of something waiting to coalesce. Within the bodies of living beings the anima of the world pools temporarily, giving rise to an astonished conscious gasp before dispersing again to dust. Nowhere in the natural world is immune. The essence of life seeps into cracks of stone and pores of wood, crystallizing over long years. After a century of solidification, a faint spirit can arise in an inanimate object. You can feel these spirits in well-worn things and places. A monastery has a soul of its own, and vibrates with the reverence of all those who walked its halls. A tool passed down from master to student exudes the traces of its lineage in its graceful motions, in the calmness of mind it brings to the working hand. An old town or an ancient valley is filled with these spirits, and a traveller will often feel enveloped by an encompassing aura when entering such places.

These days, people don't believe much in spirits anymore. Everything is too new, changes too fast. People move around, and things live past their usefulness in months. I speak about the spirits of things, but nobody takes me seriously. They can't feel them anymore, but the anima still swirls around us, and I feel it crystallizing in dangerous ways. I must be more sensitive to these things than most, having lived in a state of half-death since my birth. When they wheel me into the hospital I can feel the despair in the walls, a powerful buildup of sorrow and dread on the verge of consciousness. The road we take to the hospital is soaked through with the fatigue of daily commuters. The offices we pass radiate anxiety, and the billboards seem to house the embryos of twisted spirits full of guile and deceit. There are things growing in the prisons, in the overpasses, in the sewers.

I don't like being in this city much. Most of it was rebuilt after the war, so very few old places remain. What has pooled here afterwards is a reflection of the modern century, a new generation of spirits condensing from the passing influences of an anonymous sea of people. It's been almost a century after the war, and the entire city is beginning to stir back into existence as something alienated and angry. A leviathan is awakening, which lives in glass and plastic and silicon. I don't believe the new spirits care for us, or even for themselves. I sense that many of them resent their very existence, and curse the forces that brought them into being.

There's not much I can do about any of it. As the spirits come into this world, I feel myself slowly leaving. The momentum of the world is unstoppable, and before I die I may see the birth of the new equilibrium. I imagine my anima will go to join the spirits of the world in a concrete alley or a chain link fence or a freeway on-ramp. And as the people rush past me I will despise them and curse the world which they have created.
