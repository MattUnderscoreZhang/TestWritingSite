It was late in the afternoon when Ashtuk and Basholom were sent to slaughter the ox.

The two men strode in the fading sunlight to the mud stable beside the village, where they tied a length of rope around the neck and snout of a large bull and led him out to pasture. There, Basholom tied the ox to the trunk of a tree, and produced a well-sharpened blade.

"Ashtuk," he said, "I will hold the ox steady, and you will cut his throat. Do not hesitate, for the ox will suffer if you do." So saying, he handed the blade to his friend and tilted the exposed neck of the animal.

Ashtuk passed the blade from hand to hand, looked at the ground then at the sky, and began swaying and sighing.

"You look troubled," said Basholom. "It's ok my friend, many in the village felt this way when they first slaughtered an ox".

Ashtuk looked pained. "It's not right," he said. "It's not right. Look what the world has become that creatures now live to die".

Basholom grunted softly, then replied, "Creatures have always lived to die. When we hunted it was the same. Just the same as before".

"It's not the same!" protested Ashtuk. "I have never killed a creature that I have fed! This is wrong, Basholom!"

"Ashtuk! Don't be foolish. Hunting or raising, we eat the ox. Is this not better than the old ways? Perhaps we have hunted this ox's father. Or his father's father. This one lived to eat and to sleep on straw - we have done him a great service. Look, Ashtuk!" Basholom struggled to hold the ox's head in place. "Look at this ox. He has lived the best of all lives, and his children will stay in our care.".

"His children!" cried Ashtuk. "What use are children if they are only born to be eaten? This is not a hunt, Basholom. On the plains the ox runs with his family. Their generations spread across the land. Here they spread no further than our walls. There is only death for such a creature, and for all his children. These ways are not like the old ways. Friend, this is not right..."

"It is right!" Basholom interjected fiercely. The bull was beginning to squirm now. "All the people of the valley and all the people of the hills now live this way! Even across the thirty mountains they know the new ways. This is how it is, Ashtuk, and you must change your thoughts. It is only a moment's work. You must only raise the blade and strike here!" So saying, he gestured sharply at the ox's neck.

"I disdain the new ways!" spat Ashtuk. "What is good about them? The world grows more and more insane. You have heard the stories as well. These days, there are more than animals living under a blade! The travellers say in lands afar, they keep people now as they keep oxen. Must we change our thoughts about that as well? If we do evil to this ox, we invite evil onto ourselves, Basholom!"

"You are crazy!" Basholom roared. "You are not an ox. I am not an ox. You are Ashtuk. I am Basholom. Do not tell me of things which are not true. We do not die - this ox does. And if any try to do to us what we do to this ox, we hack the heads off their bodies!"

The ox was now struggling violently, and Basholom strained to hold it in place. "Ashtuk, you must do this now! The ox is fighting me! You must act!"

Looking wildly between the ox and his friend, Ashtuk began to tremble. He took a sharp breath, raised the blade high above his head, and slashed through the rope between Basholom's hands. Bellowing, the ox pulled free from Basholom's grip and stamped with great force toward a desperate escape. The reckless abandon of his movements knocked the two men to the ground, where they covered their heads to avoid the furious kicks of the maddened animal. In a spray of dirt the ox oriented sunward and sprinted far away, leaving Ashtuk and Basholom huddled in a cloud of dust.
