Prompt: Introduce an unusual setting with dialogue only.

"Watch your step. Some of the floorboards here are starting to rot through. My guess is they're at least a few decades old."

"Holy shit buddy, talk about dank. This place looks like an abandoned mine tunnel."

"Yeah, about as deep as one too. I've gone down four or five levels, and there's no end in sight yet."

"Four or five?"

"It's hard to tell. The floors aren't so clear-cut in here. The tunnels slope up and down, and there's steps in the middle of nowhere. I want to keep going, but the lights further down are hooked up to these old generators that don't seem to work anymore, and besides I want to check the air down here as well."

"Good thinking. So what's the story here? Did your realtor know about these tunnels?"

"No, it was a surprise to her as well. Sarah and I found the entrance under our floorboards when we were remodeling, and I thought it was an old well at first."

"What'd she say?"

"Sarah?"

"The realtor."

"She was surprised, but I didn't tell her about the extent of it. I might have implied it was a small cellar, but either way she didn't know a thing about it. Sarah and I spent all morning exploring the top sections. These passages are clearly hand-dug, and they don't seem to be arranged in any logical way."

"You think the previous owners did this?"

"No, I've met them. They're a pretty straight-laced yuppie couple. Can't really imagine them having anything to do with this. Besides, some of the stuff down here looks like it was built before they were born. If anything it would have been the old guy before them. I heard he lived here for decades."

"Guess people had different hobbies before the internet."

"Yeah, or mental illness."

"You think he boarded up the entrance before he sold the place?"

"Oh, he didn't sell the place. He abandoned it. Just disappeared one day."

"Buddy, I'm getting horror story vibes from this. What happened to him?"

"I don't know."

"How deep is this thing?"

"I don't know."

"... Are you hearing that? Down below?"

"... I think you're imagining it."

"Am I?"

"I don't know."
